### FizzBuzz OOP

This is a programme written to perform the FizzBuzz test on a set of numbers using an object oriented programming format.

Methods were written to check if a value is divisible by 3 and 5 or both. For 3 the programme would display Fizz, for 5 Buzz and for both FizzBuzz. For all other numbers the number would be returned.

Tests were written using rspec to check the the programme was working correctly.
