# RSPEC Practice

[RSPEC Documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec)

This is a programme created to practice using RSPEC.

RSPEC was used to design and run tests on various seperate functions such as fizzbuzz and other mathematical problems.

READMEs for each of the programmes can be found in each folder.

In order to run the tests the rspec gem must be installed.

In your terminal run the following code:

```
gem install rspec
rspec
```
The second line runs the tests.

### Unit testing

Each one of the folders containing rspec files in this repo is an example of a unit test. This is where a unit of code is tested to make sure it is working correctly.
