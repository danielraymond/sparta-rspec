# RSPEC Practice

This is a programme created to practice using RSPEC.

RSPEC was used to design and run tests on various seperate functions such as fizzbuzz and other mathematical problems.

READMEs for each of the programmes can be found in each folder.

In order to run the tests the rspec gem must be installed.

In your terminal run the following code:

```
gem install rspec
rspec
```
The second line runs the tests.
